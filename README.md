R scripts for spatial analyses of the Centinela flora. 

## GBIF download and cleaning
R scripts

## Species ranges
"elev_species_final.csv": elevational ranges per species 

"elevation_PAN_COL_PER_ECU_0.5sec.tif": elevation raster

R scripts used to estimate species range sizes in the paper. 

Users will need to download their own GBIF data, edit script to reflect the user environment and filenames, and then run it the command line. The large sizes of the rasters and shapes in our analyses made this scripts run very slowly, like 30 minutes per species.
